## **Project Goals**

To create a "proof of concept" of an up-scale restaurant, ready to receive reservations.

***

## **User Goals**

### **First Time Users Goals**

+ As a parent of popular children, I want to know what foods are popular right now before anyone else's kids come to my house.
+ As someone who rarely hosts guests at my house, I only know my food preferences; I'd like to make an educated guess about others, rather than just make guesses.
+ I'm curious if my food preferences are very unique or not.

### **Frequent User Goals**

+ I own a small grocery store, I want to stay on top of any shifting trends.
+ I run a cooking channel, so if people start getting really into potatoes, I want to be ready to shift my videos accordingly.
+ I'm someone obsessed with data, and I want to see if the general public's food preferences change or stay the same.

### **All User goals**

+ I want solid data on the different popularities of food.
+ I want to know what kinds of food will make me popular.
+ I don't want to deal with a cluttered website -- I just want the numbers!

### **Fulfillment**

Because the application is terminal-based, the appearance stays minimalistic, ensuring a low chance of getting distracted with unnecessary clutter.
> I don't want to deal with a cluttered website -- I just want the numbers!

After inputting your own preferences, the average scores for non-vegetarians or vegetarians, depending on your preferences, will print out, along with the most popular food at the moment.
> As a parent of popular children, I want to know what foods are popular right now before anyone else's kids come to my house.

>As someone who rarely hosts guests at my house, I only know my food preferences; I'd like to make an educated guess about others, rather than just make guesses.


>I own a small grocery store, I want to stay on top of any shifting trends.

>I'm someone obsessed with data, and I want to see if the general public's food preferences change or stay the same.

>I want solid data on the different popularities of food.

The survey will tell you the current most popular food (out of the six or nine, depending on user's diet choice).
>I'm curious if my food preferences are very unique or not.

>I want to know what kinds of food will make me popular.

>I run a cooking channel, so if people start getting really into potatoes, I want to be ready to shift my videos accordingly.

## **Structure**

### **Navigation**

+ After opening the survey, users will be asked their name -- for users with no terminal experience, this will open the door to typing in answers.
+ After being asked for their name, users are then asked if they're vegetarians or not.
+ The app will walk you through two or three separate questions.
+ Each question corresponds to a category (everyone is asked about fruits and vegetables, and non-vegetarians are asked another question about meat).
+ Users will not need to do anything for their data to be put into the correct column, other than the initial diet question.

### **Survey Input**

+ Inputs can only be made with the keyboard.
+ Input is validated wherever an input can be made, so that it fits the google sheet.
+ Input validation testing can be seen in the testing section.

**Input for diet**
+ Much of the program depends on a "yes" or "no" answer to the diet question. A "y" or "n" response will also be accepted.

![diet input](media/readme-images/diet2.jpg)

+ When a choice is made, both the content of the survey and where the diet is stored are decided.

+ If a user puts in anything other than "yes"/"y" or "no"/"n", they are prompted to try the question again. This ensures the program not only runs correctly, but that the data is correctly sorted.

![diet incorrect input](media/readme-images/diet-wrong.jpg)

**Input for Rating Foods**
+ After the diet field has been satisfied, users are prompted to rate three foods from a value of 1-10.

+ If the user puts in anything other than a number between 1-10, the question is repeated.

![survey incorrect input](media/readme-images/survey-wrong.jpg)


**All user inputs are valid**
+ If the survey's questions are answered correctly, the data is pushed to either the "Standard" or "Vegetarian" tabs in Google Sheets.


![answer is valid](media/readme-images/survey-correct.jpg)

+ The number of responses is also increased by one -- this is done after validation to ensure incomplete responses aren't counted.

**Data is incorrect**
+ If the diet receives an incorrect value, eg, anything other than "y"/"yes" or "n"/"no", they are made to input another response. See previous error images as an example.

+ If the user inputs a number not between 1-10, a number with a decimal space, or a letter, they are asked the question again.


## **Features**

### **Existing Features**

**Program**
+ Terminal based for quick responsiveness
+ Google sheet to contain survey data
+ The simple instructions and automation ensures the program is applicable for all ages, requiring minimal tech literacy

**Inputs**
+ This program uses keyboard inputs for quick navigation
+ Data input to fill out a google sheet
+ Input validation for input fields to minimize incorrect data entries or breaking the program

**Current averages for a given diet**
+ After the survey is completed, users will be given a dictionary with the averages for their diet-group
+ This uses the number of responses to divide each element in the relevant sheet, added together

**Most Popular**
+ The averages list of the user's diet-group is then analyzed
+ The cell with the highest average is, therefore, the most popular
+ This information is then relayed to users at the end of the survey.

**Color Coding**
+ Error messages are red
+ Each survey question is color-coded, so users don't get confused
+ When the survey is simply talking, the printed statement is blue
+ When the survey is working, or giving data, the printed statement is cyan
+ Finally, the rating instruction to separate values by commas is bright white, in contrast to the instruction to rate between 1-10

### **Features left to implement**

+ Ability to view the data for the not-selected food-group
> Since the application is intended for personal use first, and commercial use second, this feature was not implented due to time-constraints
> For now, users who are curious about the other end can have a friend whose preferences correspond answer the survey, or take it again themselves. 

+ A final question before the data is sent to Google sheets
> The questions are very simple, and not exactly life-or-death, so for now this feature is absent.

+ Do the survey again without pressing "run program"
> Since this is a survey, it's suboptimal to encourage users to put in answers to it more than once.

***

## **Testing**

+ Each input option was tested to ensure only the intended options are put in
+ Every thinkable error was tested for given exceptions
+ For reference, the valid input is "yes" or "no" (or "y" or "n") for the diet question
+ Valid input for the rating questions are only whole numbers between 1 and 10, separated by commas
+ Since the internet connects the entire world, it's better safe than sorry. therefore, the name input is not restricted.

### **Input Validation**

In this program are various methods for inputting data:

+ Using the keyboard to rate food groups
+ Using the keyboard to type "yes" or "no" to the diet question

Each input field within the program is safeguarded against errors through one of the following mechanisms:

+ **Restricting input to the diet question to only "yes"/"y" or "no"/"n".**

![diet validation](media/readme-images/diet-wrong.jpg)


+ **Validate Ratings**  
    - Every rating must be 3 whole numbers, between 1-10, and separated by commas. See above input examples.


+ **Validate Numbers with Decimals**  
    - As depicted in the image below, only numerical inputs with no decimals are accepted.

![validate numbers without decimals](media/readme-images/decimal-wrong.jpg)

### **Input Validation Testing**
Validation is obviously crucial for any programming project, and in this case, almost everything hinges on a correct input to the diet question -- otherwise, the intended sorting will not happen, and users may not be asked the meat question at all.

Testing has been conducted the following way:
1. Running the program
2. Following the instructions to enter various inputs
3. At every step the following inputs have been tested

| Input              |       |        | Value    |              |              |   |   |   |
| ------------------ | ----- | ------ | -------- | ------------ | ------------ | - | - | - |
| Numbers to Ratings | 1,2,3 | 1,11,3 | 10,5,5.5 | 10.3333,5,10 | 10,10,11.555 | 10,10,10,10  |   |   |
| Numbers to Diet    | 1     | 2      | 0        |              |              |   |   |   |
| Words to Diet      | Yes   | yes    | No       | no           | Y            | y | N | n |
| Words to ratings   | Yes   | no     | No       | no           | Y            | y | N | n |
|                    |       |        |          |              |              |   |   |   |

Thus, the project is ready!

Correct Input - The program moves along accordingly

![correct message](media/readme-images/survey-correct.jpg)

Incorrect Input = The input is declined and a decline message in red is displayed. The program reacts and repeats the last input sequence until valid input is provided. See prior images for an example.

**Testing Results**
